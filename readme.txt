For Part 2: 
    - disklist checks root directory and subdirectories as well. 

    - Please test root directory and any sub directory separately.

    - Also, please note that this program has a security flaw such that 
        if you type in a filename as a subdirectory to search then the program will
        spit out some contents of that file if it exists at the location specified 

        Eg: ./disklist test.img /mkfile.cc 
        (Since this case isnt being tested on, there shouldnt be a need to run it.)
        (I have made note of it just for reference to the marker :) )
